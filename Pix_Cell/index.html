                    It no longer cares about charging, the battery doesn't last longer than your 
                    patience, the headphone jack no longer lets you listen to that music, 
                    among countless other unacceptable behaviors that leave you out of your mind and 
                    all this when you need it most. 
                    Calm down... here at Pix_Cell Repairs we have the solution to your problem. 
                    Ahhh, and if your notebook and tablet have also shown such rebelliousness, 
                    they are lazy or a little disconnected, get in touch, request a quote and 
                    we will be delighted to get your equipment in shape again.</p>
