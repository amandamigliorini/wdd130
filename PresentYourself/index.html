    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Amanda Migliorini and I am from Brazil. I am married and I have a 10 years old daughter.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints for 16 years and one of my favorites scripture is the story of the brother of Jared, especially because I learned from it that I have to take action on whatever problem that I have and Heavenly Father will help me when I seek for Him.</p>
    <p>I work as a programming teacher for children and I am pursuing a bachelor degree of Software Development because I love technology since I was a child and I love to create new things using technology.</p>
    <p>I enjoy reading fantasy books and watch movies.</p>
